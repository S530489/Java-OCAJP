Difference between ArrayList and Vector in Java
==============================
•	java.util.Vector came along with the first version of java development kit (JDK).
•	java.util.ArrayList was introduced in java version1.2, as part of java collections framework.
•	All the methods of Vector are synchronized. But, the methods of ArrayList are not synchronized. 
•	All the new implementations of java collection framework are not synchronized.
•	Vector and ArrayList both uses Array internally as data structure. 
•	They are dynamically resizable. Difference is in the way they are internally resized. 
•	By default, Vector doubles the size of its array when its size is increased. 
•	But, ArrayList increases by half of its size when its size is increased.
===============================
Vector or ArrayList? Which is better to use in java?
-------------------------------------------
In general, executing a ‘synchronized’ method results in costlier performance than a unsynchronized method. Keeping the difference in mind, using Vector will incur a performance hit than the ArrayList. But, when there is a certain need for thread-safe operation Vector needs to be used.
