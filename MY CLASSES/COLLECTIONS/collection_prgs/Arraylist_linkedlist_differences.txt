Difference between arraylist and linkedlist: 
------------------------------------------------
•	Since Array is an index based data-structure searching or getting element from Array with index is pretty fast. 
•	Array provides O(1) performance of get(index) method but remove is costly in ArrayList as you need to rearrange all elements. 
•	On the Other hand LinkedList doesn't provide Random or index based access and you need to iterate over linked list to retrieve any element which is of order O(n).
•	Insertions are easy and fast in LinkedList as compared to ArrayList because there is no risk of resizing array and copying content to new array if array gets full. 
•	ArrayList also needs to update its index if you insert something anywhere except at the end of array.
•	Removal is like insertions better in LinkedList than ArrayList.

Disadvantage ::
-----------------
	At each node in an LinkedList not only the element but also the 
addresses will be stored which kills the memory.
