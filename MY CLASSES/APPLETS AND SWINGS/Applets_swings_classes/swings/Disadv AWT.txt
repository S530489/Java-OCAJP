Disadvantages of AWT:

1. When we are creating a component that internally called Native method that written in C. The native method then internally creates equivalent peer component.

2. The look and feel of AWT components are changing depending upon the O.S.

3. AWT components are called Heavy Weight Components i.e AWT components are take more memory and more processing time.

Because of the above 3 disadvantages of AWT the Java Soft people rewrite the AWT as JFC to create components without using any native methods internally.


JFC (Java Foundation Classes) :

Entire JFC develloped in java only. JFC overcomes the disadvantages of AWT.

JFC is an extension of the original AWT. It contains libraries that are completly portable.

1. JFC Components are light weight. They take less system resources.

2. JFC components will have same look andd feel on all platforms.

3. The programmer can change the look and feel as suited for a platform.

4. JFC offers a rich set of components with lots of features.

5. JFC does not replace AWT. JFC is an extension to AWT.

Note: javax.swing package contains JFC.
