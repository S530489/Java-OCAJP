## public static void main(String args[])
---------------------
	This is a predefined method provided by JVM, and 
java interpreter will be calling only this method for executing a java class.

## 'static' is a predefined java keyword used to provide 
memory for member functions of any java class or any 
java variable before the execution of the java program.
static members are stored in a memory area called as 
'Method Area' and as well .class files are also stored in 
method area.

## 'public' is a predefined java keyword used to provide access for any java function or variable outside the scope 
of any folder in which java program is existing.

## println() --> this is a static method available in a 
predefined java class named as 'java.lang.System'

## There is no need of importing the System class because 
java developers has designed the java software in a way that the basic classes and package will be made available  by default.
	one such java package is 'java.lang'

## println() method is used to print any value in the format of a string 

## In java.lang.System class there are three static keywords. They are 

1) out --> this is a static keyword which helps in transfering physical data 
from the program on to the console screen

2) in --> this static keyword is used to take the input data from the console screen to the program

3) err --> this static keyword of the System class is used to send the error 
messages from the java program to the console screen
