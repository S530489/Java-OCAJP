Arrays
======

	Array is group of elements with the same name with same data type. Array is a collection of homogeneous elements. In java Array is also an object. So in java array need to be declared and should be assigned memory.

	To declare an array syntax
	==================

	dataType arrayname[];

	arrayname=new datatype[no_of_elements];

	Example
	=========
	int arr[];

	arr=new int[10];

	So here an array of integer created with 10 elements. So here arr is an object.

	Through arr we can access elements of the array.

	To access an element of an array syntax is

	arrayname[index_no]=value;

	Example
	=========
	arr[0]=10;
	arr[1]=20;
	.
	.
	arr[n]=33;

	
	We can also assign directly the members to the array in declaration time syntax


	dataType arrayname[]={elements};

	Ex:
	
	int arr[]={45,67,88,99};

Array Passing to a Function
==================

	Array will be passed to the function by reference . That mean any changes in the function will be reflected to the actual array.


Double Dimension Array
=================

	int mat1[][]={{4,5},{6,7}};
	int mat2[][]={{7,8},{9,1}};
