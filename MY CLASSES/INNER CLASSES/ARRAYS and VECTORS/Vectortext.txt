VECTOR:

	A Vector is a heterogeneous collection of objects and is a dynamic array. Vector is not restricted by an upper bound and when
	the allowed size is full it automatically expands and reallocates memory for more elements.
		
		When an object is stored in a vector (or any allocation) it loses its exact type and is stored as a generic object. 
	when the elements are retrieved,the programmer has to take care and type cast explicitly to the actual type of the object.


Constructors:
		Vector()
		Vector(int size)
		Vector(int size,reallocation size)
		Vector(Collection)

Methods:
		size(): --> Returns the no.of elements that are containing.
		
		capacity(): ---> Returns the total size of the vector.

		boolean isEmpty(): --> Returns true if the vector is empty.

		addElement(obj): --->Adds an object to vector at the end.

		insertElementAt(obj,int): --->Inserts the object at specified index.

		boolean removeElement(obj): ---> Removes the element specified and returns true if the element is found and removed.
		
		elementAt(int), firstElement(), lastElement(): --> They returns object from specified position.
		
		Enumeration elements()---> Returns the elements of the vector in the form of Enumeration object.

		boolean hasMoreElements()---> Returns true if there exist elements if Enumeration object.
